Subplot grid for plotting pairwise relationships in a dataset.

This package maps each variable in a list onto a column and row in a grid of multiple axes. 

It can also represent an additional level of conditionalization with the 'factor' parameter (a series), which plots different subets of data in different colors and/or point/circle types. This is used to resolve elements on a third dimension.

Public Functions
----------------

binary_encode
=============
Binarize data (set feature values to 0 or 1) according to a threshold. Values greater than the threshold map to 1, while values less than or equal to the threshold map to 0. With the default threshold of 0, only positive values map to 1.

Parameters:
-----------
X:
list, List of series to which to apply the function

threshold:
scalar, Feature values below or equal to this are replaced by 0, above it by 1. (0.0 by default)

suffix:
string, Add a suffix to the returned series' name default value "_bin")

verbose:
bool, Print details or not (per default no printout)

Returns:
--------
List of named series with binary values. The i-th series name takes the i-th input series' name plus the suffix "_bin" if not differently set.


ohe_encode
==========
Encode categorical discrete integer features of a single series as a one-hot (binary) list of series. The encoder derives the categories based on the unique values of the input series.

Parameters:
-----------
X:
series, Series with discrete values to which to apply the function

drop:
int, Decide whether to drop a resulting series. Per default no resulting series is droppped. For drop=1, the highest value of X is omitted from the encoding. For drop=2 the lowest value of X is omitted from the encoding

verbose:
bool, Print details or not (per default no printout)

Returns:
--------
List of named series with binary values. The i-th series is named 'Dx_i' where 'x' refers to the name of input series X and 'i' to the i-th distinct value of X.


means_encode
============
Compute category-wise, as identified by the discrete series G, mean values for each variable in list X.

Parameters:
-----------
X:
list, List of series to which to apply the function

G:
series, Discrete series refering to unique categories

suffix:
string, Add a suffix to the returned series' name (default value "_mean")

verbose:
bool, Print details or not (per default no printout)

Returns:
--------
List of named series with category-wise mean values. The i-th series name takes the i-th input series' name plus the suffix "_mean" if not differently set.


median_encode
=============
Compute category-wise, as identified by the discrete series G, median values for each variable in list X.

Parameters:
-----------
X:
list, List of series to which to apply the function

G:
series, Discrete series refering to unique categories

suffix:
string, Add a suffix to the returned series' name (default value "_mean")

verbose:
bool, Print details or not (per default no printout)

Returns:
--------
List of named series with category-wise median values. The i-th series name takes the i-th input series' name plus the suffix "_median" if not differently set..


pca_encode
==========
Compute category-wise, as identified by the discrete series G, principle components using all information in list X.

Parameters:
-----------
X:
list, List of series to which to apply the function

G:
series, Discrete series identifying unique categories

num_components:
int, Retrieve only the first n principle components (per default retrieve all)

mean_encode:
bool, Apply means-encoding on all X elemenets before computing the principle components of these n-encoded series.

suffix:
string, Add a suffix to the returned series' name (default value "_pca")

verbose:
bool, Print details or not (per default no printout)

Returns:
--------
List of named series with group-wise principle component values. The i-th series name takes the i-th input series' name plus the suffix "_pca" if not differently set.


low_rank_encode
===============
Compute category-wise, as identified by the discrete series G, left-singlular value matrix component by means of Singular Value Decomposition using all information in list X.

Parameters:
-----------
X:
list, List of k series to which to apply the function

G:
series, Discrete series identifying unique groups

num_components:
int, Retrieve only the first n columns of the left-singular value matrix (per	default retrieve the first k columns)

mean_encode:
bool, Apply means-encoding on all X elemenets before computing the low-rank components of these mean-encoded series.

suffix:
string, Add a suffix to the returned series' name (default value "_svd")

verbose:
bool, Print details or not (per default no printout)

Returns:
--------
List of named series with group-wise rank component values. The i-th series name takes the i-th input series' name plus the suffix "_svd" if not differently set.


mnl_encode
============
Compute category-wise, as identified by the discrete series G, left-singlular value matrix component by means of Singular Value Decomposition using all information in list X.

Parameters:
-----------
X:
list, List of k series to which to apply the function

G:
series, Discrete series identifying unique groups

num_components:
int, Retrieve only the first n columns of the left-singular value matrix (per	default retrieve the first k columns)

mean_encode:
bool, Apply means-encoding on all X elemenets before computing the low-rank components of these mean-encoded series.

suffix:
string, Add a suffix to the returned series' name (default value "_mnl")

verbose:
bool, Print details or not (per default no printout)

Returns:
--------
List of named series with category-wise rank component values. The i-th series name takes the i-th input series' name plus the suffix "_mnl" if not differently set.
